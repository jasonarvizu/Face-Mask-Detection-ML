# Face-Mask-Detection-ML
Developed a face mask detector by creating a machine learning model using TensorFlow. 
After the model was trained on the data, it had a precision score of 100% for with mask and 85% without mask. 
Applied this model to a live video camera to detect if a person is wearing a mask in real time.
